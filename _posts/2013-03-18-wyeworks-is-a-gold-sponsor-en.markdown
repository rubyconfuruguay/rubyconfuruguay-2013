[WyeWorks](http://wyeworks.com) is our second Gold Sponsor. WyeWorks develops Ruby on Rails applications for Internet Startups. They're focused on the US market, mainly Silicon Valley, trying to find the most fun and innovative projects.

WyeWorks is one of the companies in Uruguay who work exclusively with Ruby and Rails. Santiago, Founder of WyeWorks, is the first Uruguayan member of the Rails Core Team. They've been with us since the begining and we're really greatful for having them supporting the event once again:

>We love Open Source and therefore give back to the community investing in the Rails development. We are also sponsors of RailsConf (USA), GoGaRuCo (USA), Tech Meetup (Uruguay), PyCon (Uruguay) and of course RubyConf (Uruguay). We'd like to thank the organizers for putting together this amazing conference!
