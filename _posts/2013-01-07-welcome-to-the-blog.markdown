This will be the third edition of **RubyConf Uruguay**. Ruby Conf Uruguay is a single-track conference aimed at developers with topics such as Ruby, Rails, Scrum, JavaScript, NoSQL, and more.

We are using this blog as a tool to keep you updated on everything that will be happening before, during and after the conference this year, which will be held on March 22nd and 23rd.

The **call for papers is open**, so you are welcome to [submit your proposal](http://bit.ly/rubyconf-uy-2013-cfp). If you have more than one proposal, submit them all! If someone else had the **same** idea you did, then you both may talk at the conference! We'll be telling you about the speakers as we confirm them.

**We are looking for sponsors**, so if you want to help us organize the best Ruby event in South America, check out the [sponsorship plans](http://rubyconfuruguay.org/downloads/sponsorship_packages_2013_rubyconf_uy_v3.pdf). We've set Gold (limited quantities) and Silver sponsorhip packages but we're open to talk about other sponsorship ideas.
