To facilitate lodging and transportation for those coming to RubyConf Uruguay from afar, we are working on collaboration with [TransHotel](http://www.transhotel.com.uy/). We built some lodging and transportation packages from and to the airport, specific to the conference attendees.

The prices are promotional with discounts for attendees. There are hostels and different category hotels.

You can check the packages from [this link](http://app.transhotel.com.uy/Eventos/rubyconfeng.aspx).

If you need more info on tickets, you can e-mail [operaciones1@transhotel.com.uy](mailto:operaciones1@transhotel.com.uy). Tell them we sent you ;)
