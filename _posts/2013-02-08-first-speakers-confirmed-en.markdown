After a long night of decisions, we are in the position to confirm you our first 3 speakers:

## Jano González

Developer, amateur musician and addicted to talks. He's created from small webapps to complex enterprisey architectures, actually the CTO of [HopIn](http://hop.in). During his free time he plays music and tries to practice sports (withouth much success).

Jano is crossing the Andes from Chile to join us for RubyConf for the second time. He spoke at RubyConf Uruguay 2011 and also at our sister conference [RubyConf Argentina 2012](http://rubyconfargentina.org). Due to the shared love of Jano by Argentinians and Uruguayans alike, he's been also known as "Jano Of America" since then.

## Vicent Martí

[Vicent Martí](http://twitter.com/vmg) used to make videogames, but he sold out because he likes to wear expensive clothes. Or any clothes at all. He now works full time as a systems engineer at GitHub, focusing on security and performance issues on the backend. He's also the maintainer of libgit2, the Git library that powers GitHub's backend and native clients. He takes long showers because he enjoys smelling nice.

He used to live in Finland doing Research on Computer Graphics at the same university as Linus Torvalds. After que core dumped an alpha version of the Death Star, he moved to San Francisco to be a unicorn tamer at GitHub.

## Bryan Helmkamp

[Bryan](http://twitter.com/brynary) is the founder of Code Climate, an automated code review tool for Ruby apps, and the lead organizer of the Gotham Ruby Conference in NYC. For the last seven years, he's been an active in the Ruby community as an acclaimed speaker, author and open source contributor. In 2009, he received a Ruby Hero Award for his efforts.

We are very proud of being able to have such a Ruby Hero among our speakers, we thank people like Bryan for using their superpower for good, making this world a better place.

Stay tuned, we will be announcing more speakers next week.
