For the third time in a row, we are hosting RubyConf Uruguay at the **Torre de las Telecomunicaciones** building.

We will have the auditorium as we did in the previous editions. The place is great for this kind of events, it has a capacity of 380 seats and we will hook you up with sockets for your laptops and charging needs and WiFi.

This year we are adding the "Interactive room" with a big capacity in the ground floor of the auditorium building. This room will be the place for lunch and coffee breaks. We added the Interactive room looking to have more space and comfort during the breaks. This adds more space on the foyer for stands and other activities.

On the first year we had a pairing station somewhere outside the auditorium. If you have an idea for this kind of activity, [let us know](http://bit.ly/rubyconf-uy-2013-cfp).
