Our first keynote will be by the great Jim Weirich:

<img src="/media/img/speakers/jim-weirich.jpg" style="float:right; margin-left: 10px;" alt="Jim Weirich"/>Jim Weirich first learned about computers when his college adviser suggested he take a computer science course: "It will be useful, and you might enjoy it." With those prophetic words, Jim has been developing now for over 25 years, working with everything from crunching rocket launch data on supercomputers to wiring up servos and LEDs on micro-controllers.  Currently he loves working in Ruby and Rails as the Chief Scientist at Neo, but you can also find him strumming on his ukulele as time permits.

His keynote: **Why aren't you using Ruby?**

Are you curious about Ruby? Perhaps you've heard fantastic things
about how Ruby makes you 100 times more productive. Or maybe you've
heard the hype about this fantastic web framework called Rails that
allows to you build your complete app in 5 minutes during a coffee
break. And all this talk about meta-programming and dynamic languages,
is it really that different from what you are using now?

While there certainly is a lot of buzz surrounding Ruby and Rails,
there is also some basis for the buzz. This talk will cut through the
hype and get down to the real reasons you might want to make Ruby your
next programming language.

What a better way to kick off our conference than with this keynote! Jim is a very important player in the Ruby Community and we're very glad to have him at the conf.
