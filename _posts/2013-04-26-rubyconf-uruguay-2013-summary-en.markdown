First of all, we want to say **THANK YOU**. Thanks to the speakers, the attendees, the sponsors, the organizers, and everyone who made RubyConf possible. RubyConf Uruguay 2013 was a huge success, we loved sharing this event with the community.

We recorded all the talks and we are uploading them for everyone to watch them and share them. We'll start posting them here on the blog so [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rubyconfuruguay) and stay tuned to see new videos coming up.

In the meantime, here's a short video that summarizes the two great days we had at RubyConf 2013:

Watch it, share it and recall the event with other Rubysts :)
