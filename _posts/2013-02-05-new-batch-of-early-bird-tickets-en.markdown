The fifth batch of Early Bird tickets is now open at $ 50 USD. Remember general tickets will be at $ 80 USD once the Early Bird tickets are over.

There are more than 100 attendees already confirmed, we are really happy so many people are coming to the conference. Not to mention the more than 70 talk proposals. We are having a really tough time choosing the talks with so many great proposals.

If you are coming to Montevideo for the conference from far away, check out the [discounts TransHotel got for attendees](http://rubyconfuruguay.org/news/lodging-and-tickets-oportunities-for-rubyconf-uruguay-en). If in doubt or need help, get in touch with them and ask them for help getting hotel or transport services at a discount price.
