Jano is from Chile, currently working as CTO of HopIn. We announced him as a speaker in the [first batch](http://rubyconfuruguay.org/news/first-speakers-confirmed-en), but due to his grace, insight and humour, the responsibility of the closing keynote now rests upon him. His keynote:

## How Ruby programmed me

It's a known fact that language models the way we think, how do programming languages do that with the programmer

There are two forces fighting each other inside a programmer: The hacker who wants to do things fast with a "ship it" attitude but at the risk of creating shitty code. The perfectionists who looks for the most elegant solution, but at the risk of suffering "analysis paralysis" thinking of the best solution. How can a language like Ruby allow us to achieve balance between both approaches?

If you're around, make sure you check out [Jano's talk at the University](http://rubyconfuruguay.org/news/jornada-en-facultad-de-ingenieria-en/) with John Britton from GitHub on Monday March 18!

After Jano's talk, we'll have some beers at the conference, as a preview for that night's Drink-up! Stay tuned for more info!
