We are overwhelmed by the quantity and quality of talk proposals we've received. We have 73 proposals from people all around the world. This makes our job of building the agenda extremely hard, with so many amazing talk proposals we don't want to leave anyone out.

Stay tuned next week as we start confirming speakers for the conference. We are really thankful with everyone who sent their proposals. You people rock, and this will be an awesome conference.
