## Cyril David

Currently using Ruby, but very much in love with Go. Hopes to go super bare metal doing systems programming one day.

On a personal note she's a 25 year old foul-mouthed, American lady who worships swiss influenced design, enjoys cigarettes, and quality time with her Newfoundland pup, Roscoe.
