Today we are announcing three more speakers that will join us for RubyConf Uruguay:

## Patricio Mac Adden

"pato", [Patricio](http://twitter.com/maxawen) likes objects, good practices, tests and beers (homebrew). Since he started developing he's used several languages, but found love at first sight with Ruby. He's a Computing Graduate from UNLP (Universidad Nacional de La Plata) where he works and teaches. A few months ago he started a Ruby Group in La Plata to transmit the language and gather rubists from the city.

We personally met Patricio at [RubyConf Argentina](http://rubyconfargentina.org) where we shared long talks after a bunch of beers at the drink-up. He promised to submit a talk proposal at RubyConf Uruguay, kept his word and was accepted. 

## Fernando Ipar

<img src="/media/img/speakers/fernando-ipar-01.jpg" style="float:right; margin-left: 10px;" alt="Fernando Ipar"/>[Fernando](http://fernandoipar.com) began with BASIC on a TK-90, what according to Dijkstra makes him useless for programming tasks. Maybe because of that, he works as a consultant in the MySQL world and related technologies, though he uses every opportunity to automate. He learned about Ruby at his job, and with Go, it leads his favourite imperative languages list. For pleasure, he lately prefers to code in Clojure, Go and Prolog.

He's an active member of the development community in Uruguay and one of the co-organizers of the MySQL meetups which takes place monthly.

## Luismi Cavallé

<img src="/media/img/speakers/luismi-cavalle-01.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="Luismi Cavallé/>[Luismi](http://twitter.com/cavalle) works at BeBanjo. He's been putting together lines of Ruby code for his own enjoyment and profit since 2006. He's an active open-source contributor and got his 15 minutes of fame a couple years back as the author of Steak (later revealed as a [scam](http://steak-is-a-scam.heroku.com)). He's been involved with the Spanish Ruby community organising and speaking at local conferences and leading the Madrid Ruby users group. He lives now in London.

We look forward to talk with Luismi about his work with the Ruby User Groups in Spain and how to build bridges between Spanish speaking Ruby communities.

Stay tuned as we'll be announcing more speakers these days and as they confirm. Don't forget to [buy your ticket](http://rubyconfuy2013.eventbrite.com/), they are at 55 dollars right now till they're over or until the next batch on Tuesday, February 19th, whatever happens first.
