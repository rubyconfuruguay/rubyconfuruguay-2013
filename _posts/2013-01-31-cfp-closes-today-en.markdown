Today is the last day to [submit a talk proposal to RubyConf Uruguay](http://bit.ly/rubyconf-uy-2013-cfp). We've received awesome proposals and we'll have a hard time deciding which ones to pick for the conference. The speakers will be announced next week.

You still have some time left to submit a proposal, so if you want to present something, if you've come up with a last minute idea for a talk, this is the moment, [submit now](http://bit.ly/rubyconf-uy-2013-cfp).

We are expecting a really awesome lineup for our agenda, we're pretty excited to tell you who will be speaking. Tune in next week as we start unveiling the confirmed speakers!
