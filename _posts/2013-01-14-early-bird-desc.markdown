We were really surprised by how fast our first batch of Early Bird tickets sold out. All 30 tickets were sold in less than 72 hours.

The next batch will be at U$S 35 and we'll have 35 tickets at that price. This batch starts on **January 15th, that's TOMORROW**.

Check out [the event page on Eventbrite](http://rubyconfuy2013.eventbrite.com/) tomorrow to get your Early Bird tickets.
