We have received some great proposals for speaking at this year's conference. If you want to send yours, there's still time. The Call For Proposals closes on Thursday, January 31st.

After closing the CFP, we are selecting the talks. We'll announce the confirmed speakers the first week of February. 

We are accepting talks in English or Spanish. There's going to be simultaneous translation for both languages. 

[Submit your proposal today](http://bit.ly/rubyconf-uy-2013-cfp).
