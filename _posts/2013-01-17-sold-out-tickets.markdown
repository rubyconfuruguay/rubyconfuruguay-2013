We are really glad to announce the second batch of Early Bird tickets sold out in less than 48 hours :)

This batch had 35 tickets at U$S 35. Next batch, tickets will have a cost of U$S 40, and it will be live on Tuesday, January 22nd. Take advantage of the Early Bird before we run out, and get your ticket at a promotional price.

Thanks to everyone for the support we've been having so far. We are making RubyConf Uruguay 2013 the best RubyConf Uruguay yet!
