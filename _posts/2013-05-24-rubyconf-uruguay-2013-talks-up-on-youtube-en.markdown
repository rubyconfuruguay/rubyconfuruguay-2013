We recorded every talk in the conference and uploaded them to YouTube. There were talks in Spanish and English, so we made two playlists:

  * **Original language** - with audio in English and Spanish. This is the playlist for all the [videos in original language](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxx5qlTQCf0z2oFGlTDvLJTNMEKpgyopE):

  * **Translation** - with translation audio track on top (Spanish to English, English to Spanish). Here's the [playlist for all these videos](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxx5qlTQCf0wupbvnbnIz5SWS7ZTkK8p0):
