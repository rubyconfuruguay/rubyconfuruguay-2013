# RubyConf Uruguay 2013's website

This is a simple Jekyll website. Just install the `jekyll` gem, and run

    $ jekyll --server

From the directory where you have this code. BAM. Open `http://localhost:4000`
and you'll be basking in this technological wonder called The Future.

## Legal

The contents of the website are Open Source under an MIT license (see below).

The design, logos, and images are not, and you need to ask for permission if you
want to reuse any of them. We'll probably say yes to anything that doesn't
damage the brand, so just file an issue and we'll let you know :)
